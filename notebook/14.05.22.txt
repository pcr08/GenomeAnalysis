I forgot to update the notebook these last weeks:

I got to finish all the analyses:
- Differential expression (BWA, SAMTOOLS and HTseq)
- Extra analysis 1: Which genes are expressed and which function has, comparing between samples
- Extra analysis 2: which pathways are impplied in the expressed genes

The code script that has "bad" before is because I did the analysis with all the bins together and when I looked for the differential expression I got no results.
